rbot is an IRC bot written in Ruby. It makes use of the JSON and libxml-ruby libraries for parsing web API responses.

This is still very much a work in progress. Many things do not work or are not implemented yet. Feel free to do whatever you want with the source code--this is project is just a learning process for me.

I realize there's already something called rbot, but I really can't come up with a better name. Maybe you can help me.
